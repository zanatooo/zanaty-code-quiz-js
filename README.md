# zanaty-code-quiz-js

This a quiz app that when I click the start button
I'm presented with a question. When I answer a question, I am presented with another question and I can view my scores and I see a progress bar. 
When I finish the quiz, I can view my scores and save them; then the game is over
When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.
I can start over if I want to!
